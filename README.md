# Gulp Workflows

* Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to convert ES6 to code every browser can support? Of course! 
* Wouldn't it be cool if you could include module support from Node in client side code? Certainly.
* What could do this sort of magic for us? *Gulp Tasks*!

## Introducing: Gulp

* Gulp is a software built on Node.
* It runs **tasks** that manipulate files on your system.
* It is an active, open-source project.
* There are many community-built plugins built to work directly with gulp.
* It is commonly used for bundling, minificiation, and ES6 support.
* **Grunt** is a popular alternative to Gulp.
